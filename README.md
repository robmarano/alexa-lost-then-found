FAQ

1. What is "Lost Then Found"
Hello! So happy to see you. A new digital lost and found shop opened up in town here in Alexa Land. It's called Lost Then Found. It helps you keep track of where you place or hide your valuable things. I promise to not tell anyone. Please ask me to either remember a thing at a location, or, find a thing.
